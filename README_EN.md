## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: you have a presentation due tomorrow, but the PPT is still blank; you have countless brilliant ideas in your head, yet your passion is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and design-oriented. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," several issues persist:

- 1️⃣ Only preset templates can be chosen, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Finished products look similar, leading to severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance.
- 5️⃣ Disconnected image-text layouts with a poor sense of design.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to satisfy our dual needs for "speed" and "aesthetics" simultaneously. Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my opinion, still far from being truly "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It accurately renders almost all text from the prompts and faithfully follows the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Novices**: Generate beautiful PPTs quickly with zero barrier and no design experience, reducing the hassle of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Use AI-generated layouts and element combinations as references to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, focusing energy on content rather than layout and beautification.
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with fast adaptation across multiple scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯 Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create beautiful and professional presentations</b>
</p>

  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via GCP service accounts; new users can use free credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Start the Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No need to build from scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After startup, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The app will determine if an update is available based on the current version SHA; when running from source, the current Git SHA will also be used for the determination.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Access the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **View Logs**

```bash
```

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# View Backend Logs in Real-time (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Front-end Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Service**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using pre-built images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

Alternatively, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using local build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable; you need to revert the code to the version it was when pulled first.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting explanation videos; must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- Valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Refurbishment" feature, used to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout displacement during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore certain special effects. LibreOffice is not required if you upload PDF files. For Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container, run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost when the container is rebuilt and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following command in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full
```

# Ubuntu / Debian

```markdown
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9
```

# Then install Python dependencies

uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then follow the aforementioned method to open and edit the `.env` file and configure your API key
