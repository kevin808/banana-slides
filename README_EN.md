## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: your presentation is due tomorrow, but your slides are still blank; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, but all your passion is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally satisfy the demand for "speed," they still face the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only able to choose from preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult to execute
- 3️⃣ Similar visual outcomes with serious homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text and image layouts with poor design sense

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously meet our two core needs for PPT production: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I experimented with using 🍌 pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text required by the prompts while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌 pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero threshold and no design experience, reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and visual elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations, focusing energy on content rather than formatting and beautification.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with quick adaptation to various scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create beautiful and professional presentations.</b>
</p>

<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models through a GCP service account, and new users can use promotional credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account and download the key file in JSON format.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Starting the Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Launch using pre-built images (No need to build from scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After startup, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The app will determine if an update is available based on the current version SHA; the current Git SHA will also be used for verification when running from source code.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```

3. **Accessing the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **View Logs**

```bash

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# View Backend Logs in Real-time (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using Pre-built Images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

Alternatively, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using Local Build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable; you need to revert the code to the version at the time of the last pull first.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploying from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting video lectures, and must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- Valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when using the "PPT Revamp" feature to upload PPTX files, used to convert PPTX to PDF. **Recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: When rendering on the server side, LibreOffice may cause layout displacement due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. LibreOffice is not required if uploading PDF files. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following in the project root directory:
```bash
```

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then install Python dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then follow the aforementioned steps to open and edit the `.env` file and configure your API key

```markdown

```

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Enter the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` via Vite proxy (default `http://localhost:5011`). If modification is needed, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file in the project root directory.

#### Start the Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under the default configuration, templates, assets, and finished products are all stored in the `uploads/` folder

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify if the service is running normally.

#### Start the front-end development server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access and use the application.
